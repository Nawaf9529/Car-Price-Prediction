# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

## 📄 **Description**
This project aims to predict the **selling price of a used car** based on a set of features such as:
- **Car age**
- **Brand**
- **Mileage**
- **Fuel type**
- **Seller type**
- **Transmission type**
- **Ownership history**

By building accurate predictive models, this project helps buyers and sellers make **informed decisions** in the used car market. The task is framed as a **regression problem**, where:
- The **target variable** is the present price of the car.
- The **features** are attributes describing the car.

## 🧠 **Models Used**
The following regression models were trained and evaluated:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**

---

## 📈 **Objective**
- Provide accurate price predictions for used cars.
- Empower users with insights to support data-driven decision-making in the automotive market.
